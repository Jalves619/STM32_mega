# Pre-compiled binary files

These are pre-compiled binary files that are tested to be working with this F407 "Mega" board. FastADC version has much faster ADC sampling rate than Speeduino normally has. Other selection is between Internal Flash EEPROM emulation and External SPI Flash EEPROM emulation. If not mentioned in the name, External SPI Flash EEPROM emulation is used. Also added option to use hardware serial (FTDI) instead of native USB. This is slower connection method, but required if bluetooth connection is used.
